# Kalabhoomi Odisha





Kalabhoomi Odisha is a Mobile(Android app) to empower and rejuvinate the lost craftsmanship, traditional and culture of rich Odisha.

Utkal, the land where every carving on the temple portrays the divine emotions, every stroke of brush shows the affection, and every delicate weaving reveals the softness of the thoughts.
The hands who follow the rituals and sanity of indigenous folklores mesmerize the eyes of every person who explores the land and dives into the depths of cultures.
Though the land is rich in its heritage and culture, the artists get lesser recognition.
The art is given enormous appreciations but the artist is left out.

Therefore our application allows the artists to get their rights and recognition and helps them to be proud birds of Odisha. It even looks after the development and regenerates the tradition and introduces the stupendous arts to the country of cultures. It provides a just chance for the craftsmen of angelic arts and crafts and gets deserving acknowledgment to them.

This will provide the culture to get the proper recognition and its soldiers, an identification. Selling and purchasing are just the processes but the result will be an amazing unity of the country.

Kala Bhoomi Odisha

Pushes you to Explore the abode of  Manoghya Sanskriti
Manoghya, meaning astounding which is the appropriate adjective to describe the Lord’s beauty who is the sole owner of the Universe. He has to be admired, not only in the lighted words but also in the pure darkness of closed eyes as he chose the simple humans to be the best of his creations. Odisha’s arts always pay respect and devotion to the Lord of the lands, Lord Jagannath.  

Sadambhodhi Vasam Galathpushpahasam,
Jagatsannivasam Sathadhithyabhasam,
Gadhachakra Sastram Lasad Peetha Vasthram,
Hasacharu Vakthram Bajeham Bajeham.

These lines from Sree Hari Stotram depict how beautiful the Lord’s face is and how it shines with his smile, how he loves to wear yellow silks and has radiance is equal to thousand suns. These are the statements that are kept in minds of every artist and sculptor which enables them to put their souls into their works. 

The yellow silks of the Sambalpuri sarees grace the eyes of the people who can see the celestial beauty, the idols of metals, mud and so on which are designed with minute guarded hands reveals the Lord’s radiance and blesses the eyes of the viewer. If every art form is a paradise then the artists are the gems who adorn it. 

Such talents are nowadays losing their locations on the maps of recognized culture and the gems are ignored as stones. This application of ours is designed to let the jewels fall into the right hands which can know the worth them and provide them with fair chances and deserving rewards and polish them to shine brighter. It helps all the forgotten and ignored arts and artists to live a dignified life of self-dependency and not to stretch hands for favors. Sharing their talent with a price tag doesn’t make them low but makes us understand the true worth.
 
Odisha’s arts always pay respect and devotion to the Lord of the lands, Lord Jagannath. Every art, craft, sculpture, scripture, weaving, and clays sing the orisons to the lord but it’s a sad thing that very less of it gets recognized. 

The devotees, the people who are responsible for the wonderful craftmanship should get justice. Their families should never be left out into hunger and poverty or lack of financial support. Therefore our application provides them their owning platform for making themselves independent and financially stable by introducing their arts and their deserving prices. This will provide the culture to get the proper recognition and its soldiers, an identification. Selling and purchasing are just the processes but the result will be an amazing unity of the country.
