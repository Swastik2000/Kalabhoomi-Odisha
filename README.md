#  Kalabhoomi Odisha 

The dexterity with the fingers and brushes delineates the nimbleness of vivid ideas and colors. The great arts of Odisha show its humbleness in its gentle wild crafts, paintings, carvings, and weavings. Stonework, silver filigree, woodcraft, appliquÃ© work, brass and bell metal work, dhokra castings, horn work, pattachitra, paper mache, terracotta, tie & dye textile in cotton,tassar, and silk, and the list goes on. 
Utkal, the land where every carving on the temple portrays the divine emotions, every stroke of brush shows the affection, and every delicate weaving reveals the softness of the thoughts. The hands who follow the rituals and sanity of indigenous folklores mesmerize the eyes of every person who explores the land and dives into the depths of cultures.
Though the land is rich in its heritage and culture, the artists get lesser recognition. The art is given enormous appreciations but the artist are left out. Therefore our application allows the artists to get their rights and recognition and helps them to be proud birds of Odisha. It even looks after the development and regenerates the tradition and introduces the stupendous arts to the country of cultures. It provides a just chance for the craftsmen of angelic arts and crafts and gets the deserving acknowledgement to them.
